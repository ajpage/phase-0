1. What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?  It was good to see the HTML we wrote take shape into an actual site.  It is one thing to go through tutorials following directions and another to be able to actually build out the content of a web page. 

2. How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
HTML5 has a lot of new tags that have improved its ability to write semantic code. This makes a computer be able to understand and identify the elements of the page. 


3. How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
I think we did well on keepting to HTML best practices and only use it to mark up the text and not format it. We focused on using headings for importance and not sizing.

4. What seems good and bad about HTML?
HTML gives page content some structure and also a clear heirarchy of things. At the same time I think it can be easy to get into bad habits of styling with HTML instead of CSS.


5. What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
A lot of the tags sound like what they are going to do or are very self explanatory. I learn best just by keeping my knowledge fresh and continuing to use what I have learned.
