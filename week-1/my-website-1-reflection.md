Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
To create a repository on GitHub first open your browser to github.com and log in to your account. In the top right corner next to your profile picture click the "+" symbol and then select "new repository" from the drop down menu. This will open the page to create your new repository. In the box under "Repository name" give it a name. Include a discription if you want. Now select either private or public. If its public anyone can see it, if its private only people you select can see it. Now make your selections for a README and if you want to add a license. MIT is least restrictive. When thats done click the "create repository" button and your new repository is made and exists on GitHub.
To clone to your local computer find the clone link. it should be in the form https://github.com/username/repository-name.git and copy it to your clipboard by highlighting the link and using control + C. In your terminal check your current directory using pwd. If you are in the directory you wish to clone the repo into stay there, if not cd into the correct directory being sure not to cd into another repo directory. Once there type git clone clone-link where clone-link is the one you copied to your clipboard. You may be prompted for your GitHub username and password. Now ls and see that your repo is on your local computer.

Describe what open source means.
Open source means that the source for a program is available to view and edit as you see fit.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
I think Open Source has its place and it's really cool that developers all over can contribute to meaningful projects. I can understand companies not wanting to make their products public domain though because they are still a business and want to make money. 

Assess the importance of using licenses.
Licesnsing means you don't lose copyright and you are listed as the original author but still allows for others to use and edit that work without having to grant specific permissions. 

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
I got more comfortable using both git and GitHub and really solidified the difference between them. I also got much more comfortable using git commands and learning how to add and commit and what that meant. I forgot to checkout a new branch for my index file at first, so I had to redo that so I wasnt writing directly to the master branch.
