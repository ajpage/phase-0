1. What is a wireframe?  
A wireframe is like a blue print of a web page. It is a visual representation of the skeletal framework.

2. What are the benefits of wireframing?  
Wireframing is beneficial to the design and development process because it defines the hierarchy of the page and allows the focus to be on what it will do instead of how it will look, ultimately making for better design and navigation. Wireframing also allows for changes to be made easier since redoing the layout at this stage does not require changing the code of the website.

3. Did you enjoy wireframing your site?  
I did enjoy wireframing my site and planning out how I want visitors to interact with it.

4. Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?  
I made a few revisions to what I had initially sketched out. I definitely saw the benefit of wireframing in this aspect as making changes was really fast and easy with immediate results.

5. What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
I really wanted a step-by-step approach to wireframe my index page when I was struggling to begin sketching it out. But then I thought back to the “6 Phases of the Web Design and Development Process” where it emphasized design to problem solve and achieve the goals of the website. When I did this and focused on promoting myself as the goal, it became easier.

6. Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?  
Once I got past my initial struggle, I enjoyed sketching out and wireframing my index page. I tried mockingbird and  website wireframe, but ultimately found them more time consuming than I wanted at the time. Finding a tool I like to use can be really tedious in my experience and this was no different, so I went with pen and paper for now.
