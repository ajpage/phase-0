1. What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?  It was good to see the HTML we wrote take shape into an actual site.  It is one thing to go through tutorials following directions and another to be able to actually build out the content of a web page. 

2. How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
HTML5 has a lot of new tags that have improved its ability to write semantic code. This makes a computer be able to understand and identify the elements of the page. 


3. How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

4. What seems good and bad about HTML?

5. What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
