<!-- 
What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why? I often use <heading> <main> <footer> <nav> <p>
because most documents will need three main sections of heading, main and the footer. Also so far a lot of the HTML I have written has needed a navigation bar so using the semantic <nav> tag makes it even better.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
Elements get laid out from top to bottom because that is how the browser reads it.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
There are a lot of things about Sublime that I don't know about that can probably make my coding experience much easier. Being able to create a snippet that has the html doctype and chartype already in it will be useful in the future as well as just the ability to create more snippets when I think they will benefit me. I need to work on my sublime shortcuts and really try to start implementing them.
