# include? : this returns a boolean value. True if the string contains the given string or character and false if it does not
# << appends the object following it to whatever it is pointing at. If it is pointing to a string it will append it to the end of the string.
#       if it is appending to an array it will be a new element
# Hash.each calls the code block for each key value pair passing the key and value as parameters 

# Person 2
# Pseudocode:
# -input: array and an integer to be added into the area
# -output: new area, overwriting old array, with new number of pets desired
# -steps
#   -define a method with two arguments (string, integer)
#   -insert the integer in correct location in string.
#   -return the new array with passed in integer

# Pseudocode:
# -input: hash and an integer to be added into current value
# -output: overwritten hash with new value for corresponding key
#   -define a destructive method to modify hash values
#   -over each key pair values in hash combine new age value added to old value
#   -return the new hash with passed in values

# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.
# -used .is_a?(Integer) -> this will go through each element in the array and decide if it is an Integer (true or false). If it is true, then it will apply the code block to that element.
# -used .each over a hash to modify the age of pets. Starts by looking at each key and then modifying the corresponding value, old_age, by adding years_to_add.


# Person 3
def my_array_sorting_method(source)
  # sort by converting the integers, if there are, into strings for the purpose of sorting only
  return source.sort {|a,b| a.to_s <=> b.to_s }
end
print my_array_sorting_method(i_want_pets)

def my_hash_sorting_method(source)
   # sort the array by pet's age
   source.sort_by {|n,a| a}
end
print my_hash_sorting_method(my_family_pets_ages)

# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.
# the sort method by default first put the integers in increasing order, than the strings starting with a capital letter in alphabetical order, the other strings
#the sort_by is more specific wgich is needed for a hash considering we have a key/value pair
#We can use the sort_by for array too and it is more perfomant than the sort  . so more adapted for larger arrays.
# I tested my method with irb 
# the rspec is working


# Person 4
def my_array_deletion_method!(source, thing_to_delete)
  source.reject! {|s| s.to_s.include?(thing_to_delete.to_s) }

def my_hash_deletion_method!(source, thing_to_delete)
  source.reject! {|n,a| n == thing_to_delete }
end
puts my_hash_deletion_method!(my_family_pets_ages,"George")


# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.
# Used the reject method combined with include
#Used the same reject method with include and made it simpler because we nom it will be a specific name
#I test all my methods with irb


# Person 5
def my_array_splitting_method(source)
  new_arr = Array.new(2)
  new_arr[0] = source.select {|item| item.is_a?(Integer) }
  new_arr[1] = source.reject {|item| item.is_a?(Integer)}
  return new_arr
end

# INPUT: An array of objects
# OUTPUT: An array with two elements
#   The first element is an array containing all the integers from the input
#   The second element is an array containing all the non-integers.
#
# An explanation of the primary methods used:
#   Calling Array.new(x) will return an array of length x populated with nil
#   values.
#
#   .select can be called on an array in the form
#     array.select { |item| block }
#   Where item is the variable name you want to have assigned the current value
#   being looked at, and block is a code block that returns a boolean.
#   For .select, it iterates through the array and returns, in an array, all
#   items from the original array that met a true condition in the block.
#   
#  Conversely, .reject works the same way, except it returns all the elements
#  that return false in the block.
#
#  In the example above, for each |item| in array, the .select and .reject
#  methods are checking if the item is of a type Integer, which is seen in
#  the code item.is_a?(Integer). 


def my_hash_splitting_method(source, age)
  new_arr = Array.new(2)
  new_arr[0] = source.select {|key,value| value <= 4 }.to_a
  new_arr[1] = source.reject {|key,value| value <= 4 }.to_a
  return new_arr
end

# INPUT: A hash with key-value pairs of type String-Integer
# OUTPUT: An array with two elements
#   The first element is an array of arrays, where each array is of the form
#   name-age, and all arrays here contain elements where the key was <= 4.
#   The second element is an array of arrays containing everything else.
#
# An explanation of the methods used can be seen above in 
# my_array_splitting_method. The only addition is the to_a method, which
# converts objects into arrays where key => value is converted to [key,value]


# There isn't a special trick to reading the documentation, since it's mostly
# a matter of understanding where everything is. The start of every search
# should always be to google for "ruby [class]" which is the class of object
# you're trying to manipulate. After reaching the ruby docs, the list of
# methods can be seen on the left-hand side under "Methods". It is important
# to read and see what the return value of each statement is on the right-side
# of the arrow within each function title. Multiple repetitions of each method
# means there are multiple ways of calling this function. After that, you just
# have to read the description, look at the examples, and test out the methods
# in an interpreter.



# Release 3: Reflect!
# What did you learn about researching and explaining your research to others?
# It can be tricky to make sure to explain things in ways someone else can understand but having good broken down pseudocode can make that much easier.
# What was your experience like researching for Ruby methods. Did you find them quickly? How easy was it to implement once you found one?
# Sometimes it is difficult to know where to begin to search for the methods you need, but it is a lot easier in Ruby than other lanuages I have seen.
# I think about it a lot like reading a text book and it is a learnable skill just not something we do typically.
# Did you find any methods you thought would work but didn't? What made you think they would work? How did you determine they didn't?
# Not this time, but I'm sure I will.
# How does the method you chose iterate through and modify information in a data structure?
# I used the each method so it goes through each element in the structure and performs the code block on it 
#Is the method you implemented destructive or non-destructive?
# Non destructive because I stored the results in a new array
# What did you learn from reading your accountability-group member's explanations on their solutions?
# I learned about item_is_a? method that I hadn't used before
# What did you learn about researching and explaining your research to others?
# I think the most difficult thing was getting everyone together to put the project together but once we got it settled we did a good job of making sure we knew what the group was doing.
