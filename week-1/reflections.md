## 1.1 Think about time

I learned about time boxing, meditation and starting small as time management and productivity ideas.  Time boxing is the practice of doing a task for a predetermined amount of time and then assessing progress at the end of that time. This can be used during Phase 0 during the challenges by setting out to work on them for a certain amount of time and then taking a break instead of working on them to completion. This way when you get stuck there is a predetermined stopping point. I currently use a system of "to-do" lists and something similar to time boxing where I give myself a time limit for a task and if it is not done I move on to something else and come back to it when I have time. This works well for things that I would otherwise procrastinate on because I know I only have to do them for 20 minutes (or however long) but I can struggle with stopping during an enjoyable activity. I will employ starting small to ease the anxiety of having to complete huge tasks. By breaking big jobs down into smaller more manageable items and giving myself a time limit on them I hope to make the work less overwhelming. For Phase 0 my time management will focus on doing something every day for at least 20 minutes and just doing something even if it is small. I will also put more focus on meditating and making that more of a daily habit. 

## 1.2 The Command Line

A shell is a user interface to perform commands given, bash acts as the shell program for most unix systems. Moving around using pushd and popd was confusing at first, but after i went through it for a second time after taking a break I could make more sense of it. It took a few tries to get cp right but I was able to use all of the commands. I think grep and wildcard matching are very powerful to be able to find files quickly without having to manually search through a file hierarchy.

pwd - print working directory
ls - list directory contents
mv - move file
cd - change directory
../ - goes up one directory in the heirarchy
touch - creates an empty file
mkdir - makes a directory
less - pages though a file
rmdir - removes a directory
rm - removes a file
help - (man in unix) brings up information about commands
