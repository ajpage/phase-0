input: array of dbc students
output: an array of arrays
steps:
take the number of elements in the input array mod 4 to see how many there will be left over if there are groups of four
IF it is less than 3 add each to a group of 4 to make 0-2 groups of 5
	ELSE if it is 3 make one group of 3 and the rest groups of 4
END IF

create an empty container to store the groups of students
WHILE there are still students left to be grouped
  put the first four students into the container of groups and remove them from the original list
